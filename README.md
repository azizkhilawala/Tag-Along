# Tag Along
Tag Along makes it easy to set up or join small events, getting users into contact with others who have similar interests.
Tag Along is designed to help people find activities near them, so they don’t have to disrupt their schedule just to have fun.
Tag Along doesn’t use groups, unlike its main competitor MeetUp, so it doesn’t put stress on the person running an event.
Without having to worry a defined group, Tag Along works with people’s busy schedules, allowing them to set up events in just a few seconds.
